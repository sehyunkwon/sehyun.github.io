Hello! I am a Ph.D student in [the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence](https://gsai.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) advised by [Ernest K. Ryu](https://ernestryu.com/). My current research interests are `Vision Language Models` and `Large Language Models`. During my Ph.D., I am honored to have been doing a deep learning research internship at [KRAFTON](https://www.krafton.ai/en/) where I closely worked with [Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/aboutme/) and [Dimitris Papailiopoulos](https://papail.io/).

Prior, I recieved M.S. degree in [the Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/board/index.php?mid=Portal) at Seoul National University and B.S. degree in [the Department of Mathematics Education](https://cms.dankook.ac.kr/web/mathedu/home) at Dankook University.

Also, I am planning to graduate in February 2025 and finding an internship or job in the industry!
