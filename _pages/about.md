Hello! I am a Ph.D student in [`the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence`](https://gsai.snu.ac.kr/) at [`Seoul National University`](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) advised by [`Ernest K. Ryu`](https://ernestryu.com/). My current research interests are Vision Language Models and Large Language Models. 

I am currently doing an AI research internship at [`NAVER AI Lab`](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab). Prior, I did a deep learning research internship at [`KRAFTON`](https://www.krafton.ai/en/).

Also, I recieved M.S. degree in [`the Department of Mathematical Sciences`](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/board/index.php?mid=Portal) at Seoul National University and B.S. degree in [`the Department of Mathematics Education`](https://cms.dankook.ac.kr/web/mathedu/home) at Dankook University.
